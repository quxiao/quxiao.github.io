    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a programmer, I wanna have place to store my note in my study. In my opinion, writing is a kind of method that can help you organize thought and understand better about what you write. By the way, you can feel very excited to have a place that belong to yourself on the web.</p>

<p>PS:</p>

<p>Why do I write in English ?</p>

<p>As a student majoring in computer, it&rsquo;s indispensable for me to have the ability to listening, reading, speaking and writing English. English can provide me a higher platform to know about my major and the world. I&rsquo;ve been studying English for several year. Even thought I&rsquo;m not very good at English now, but I never gave up. So I decide to write articles on this blog in English so as to improve my English.</p>
