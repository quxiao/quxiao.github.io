As a programmer, I wanna have place to store my note in my study. In my opinion, writing is a kind of method that can help you organize thought and understand better about what you write. By the way, you can feel very excited to have a place that belong to yourself on the web.

Why do I write in English ?

As a student majoring in computer, it's indispensable for me to have the ability to listening, reading, speaking and writing English. English can provide me a higher platform to know about my major and the world. I've been studying English for several year. Even thought I'm not very good at English now, but I never gave up. So I decide to write articles on this blog in English so as to improve my English.
